# Canvas-Freaks-Automation
This tool is used to automate processes used for commercial printing at the company Canvas Freaks. The ultimate purpose of this tool is to increase productivity at Canvas Freaks by reducing the amount of time it takes to complete consistently repeated tasks that involve the Windows File System.
All of the implementations automate processes that involve the Windows File System.
These implementations include:
a button to automatically create sub-folders, sort files, and move files to specific sub-folders for the multi panels --
a button to get the total count table for dozens of different dimensions and thickness' in selected folder (utilizing hash maps) --

a button to get total count of files for different types of Floating Frames from multiple selected folders --
and lastly, a button to sort through sub-folders in a master folder and merge alike sizes (for example: merging 36x48 and 48x36 subfolders together).
